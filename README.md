### A CLI Application for Go Ride Sharing App

This is a simple CLI application that touches the backend of [Go Ride sharing app](https://github.com/Go-Ride-Share).

This cli applicaiton is implementing a key feature of the Go Ride Sharing app, which is the ability to view your own posts after logging in.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```npm install```

### Usage
To run the application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```npm start```

To exit the application, press `Ctrl + C`.

You should be able to use email id testapp@email.com and password `12345678` to login and view sample posts that are already created.

### Debugging

If the logins fail, you might have to visit the app website and create an account for yourself [here](https://salmon-bay-0bbe0cf0f.5.azurestaticapps.net/signup). And perhaps some posts as well, so that you can view them using this CLI application.
